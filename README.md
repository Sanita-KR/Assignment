A brief overview of the architecture:

In HTML I divided the given page in three main blocks - Image, Product Info box and Add to box. 
In the Product Info Box I stacked all of the main Elements in divs in their respective order by grouping them in logical groups like - Title, Rating, Option Box. I filled the larger divs with smaller divs for each item and added the images, buttons, input fields, icons.

Short summary of my choice of stack:

I chose to use plain Javascript due to my limited knowledge in this field.  
I used CSS (with no preprocessors) for formatting due to me not having started with learning Sass or other options at the moment.
